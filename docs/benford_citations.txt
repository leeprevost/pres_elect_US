Mark J. Nigrini, Ph.D., in his new
book, “Digital Analysis Using Benford’s Law” (Global Audit Publications,
2000) suggests the use of Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as the best
measure of closeness of fit for DFA

Close conformity — 0.000 to 0.004
Acceptable conformity — 0.004 to 0.008
Marginally acceptable conformity — 0.008 to 0.012
Nonconformity — greater than 0.012
