Nevertheless, none of those critiques take away from the core rhetorical question: what explains the gap of votes for Biden
over 2016 in the 2020 election?

The question that intrigued me:

The NYT visuals that show the "shift left/right" vectors on a map got me thinking about how to use these techniques to identify where those votes came from:
